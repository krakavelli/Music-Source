A guitar capo is an accessory that clamps down across the neck of a guitar, and depending on the notes and sound you are looking to achieve by using a guitar capo you will need to select the appropriate fret. 
By bridging Capos across the neck of the guitar you are shortening the length of the strings all at the same time, creating (sort of) a new head (where the tuning pegs are). 
The “open” strings are now played higher in pitch allowing you to strum your open strings in a different pitch then the standard tune without having to tune up or down.
 
So, how much higher does the pitch increase when your guitar capo is applied? 
It's a half step for each fret. If you place the capo at the third fret (for example) the open E strings become Gs (three half steps higher in pitch than the open E). 
Each string increases in pitch equally — B becomes D; G becomes Bb; D becomes F; and A becomes C. Everything below the Capo is played as if the Capo was the head of the neck where the tuning pegs are. 
All strings above the capo are muffled and are not meant to be played. However, creativity rules the roost in music... maybe you can find some way to bend the "rules" and create some grunge heavy riff of muffled strings and distortion? 
Ok, just a thought!
